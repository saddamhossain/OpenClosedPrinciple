# SOLID Principles

**SOLID** principles are the software design principles that enable us to manage most of the software design problems. SOLID is a set of five design principles for writing maintainable and scalable software. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin, also known as Uncle Bob, in the early 2000s.

**SOLID** is an acronym where:

- **S** stands for Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **O** stands for Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
- **L** stands for Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **I** stands for Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **D** stands for Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

In this repository, we embrace the **OCP (Open-Closed Principle)**. This is what OCP means:

- A software entities (such as classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be designed in such way that it is open for extension and closed for modification.
- This means that we should be able to add new functionality to a module without changing its existing code.
