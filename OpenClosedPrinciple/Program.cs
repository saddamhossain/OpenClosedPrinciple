 Open-Closed Principle (OCP).
 This is what OCP means:
 -> A software entities (such as classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be designed in such way that it is open for extension and closed for modification.
 -> This means that we should be able to add new functionality to a module without changing its existing code.
